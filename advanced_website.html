<h2> Sports </h2>
<p>I play golf in my free time. I was on the varsity team last year for Yorba Linda High School and hopefully for Damien this year. I have played in many tournaments and have finished first many times..<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ5ha3LCqeuulRhmbgpChu2G4swcacScWhgWTuiV-ZiwM3T__nC1A" alt="A day in the life of golf" style="width:400px;"></p>

    <h2> Intrests</h2>
    <p> Outside of sports I take part in many clubs and organizations. I was in We Club last year where we donated water to kids in Africa. This year I had the chance to raise money to give a child that wanted golf lessons. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Me_to_We_logo.jpg" alt="We club" style="width:430px;"></p>
