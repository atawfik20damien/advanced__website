<h2> Practicing Golf </h2>
<p>I practice golf many time a week. Practicing has made me a better golfer. I usually go to the range for about an hour and practice my short game for an hour. Sometime I go the clubhouse to grab a bite and get a drink.<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/95/21/ff9521239c82e0cfb89bffbc6473ca3f.jpg" alt="Golf clubhouse" style="width:307px;"></p>

    <h2> Playing golf with my friends</h2>
    <p> I play golf with my friends many times when I go to golf. Playing with friends makes the game very fun and enjoyable. We always have a good time and laugh. <img src="https://i2.cdn.turner.com/dr/pga/sites/default/files/articles/PGA.12.02.13.831.jpg" alt=" Golfing with my friends" style="width:693px;"></p>

    <h2>Watching golf</h2>
    <p>A lot of time on the weekends I like to spend watching golf. My favorite player to watch is Jordan Spieth. He has been my favorite played for many years. Golf to watch is very enjoyable for me because I like to use some of their techniques for my own game. <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/588154136773795840/g6RQ1RTR_400x400.jpg" alt="Jordan Spieth" style="width:307px;"></p>
